# SLIDE ROLES

## Jerry Zhang

1. Hello everyone! We are 

    **click** plus plus three!
    
    **click** I am Jerry Zhang, the leader of the group, and these are my team mates, 
    
    **click** Samuel and 
    
    **click** Ernest

2. The challenge we chose is "Don't forget the can opener".

    This challenge requires us to make a platform for people to develop and customize
    checklist for specific kinds of disasters!
    
3. Why did we pick this topic? It's simple. Disasters - natural or man made - has a huge impact on our economy

    **click** **click** Did you know, over 2.6 trillion $ was donated by just the business community to relieve disasters
    
    **click** **click** and 40.33% of all donations was solely used to aid Hurricane Katrina
    
    **click** **click** and 21.14% if all donations are used to relieve the indian ocean tsunami
    
     **click** **click** This disasters have gotten support for almost 2000 companies world wide!
     
      **click** Imagine if we can save 1%, just 1% of these money by simply giving them a helping hand on how to get by the disaster, 
      we would be saving millions of dollars!
      
4. As a result, our team came up with and application that assists people during disasters, by allowing people 
  to not only create, but also share checklist and safe haven in the event of disasters
  
5. Our project have 4 main aims
  
    **click** Providing insights on impending dangers. 
    NASA has huge data on prediction of both natural and man made disasters via satellites imagery, allowing them
    to predict path of hurricanes and river bank over flowing resulting in floods. While prediction does not
    fall under our category, we believe the result of the predictions can be used to allow user to have a bird eye's
    view on the situation. This can both prepare the people getting affected by the disaster, and entities with
    power to help these people!
    
    **click** Next, we want to locate safe havens for people during disasters. Disasters don't come and go. Right after
    disasters, or even during disasters, there are safer places. For instance, during a flood, its safer to go to a house
    on higher group, giving both shelter and food to them as opposed to staying in the lower ground.
    
    And as Dr Bidushi has shared with us, there was a time her friend was trapped in a heavy snow, where all
    their electric appliances (like heater and lights) are all dead, but they still have cellular data, they could
    form their own connection and go to houses that still have access to electricity, saving them from being
    frozen to death!
    
    **click** thirdly, we want to allow experienced users to share plans and checklists of items for disasters they are familiar with.
    This would allow insight of other people's creative methods and also help foreign people, especially people in
    Singapore, who hardly ever experience disasters, with wealth of knowledge and guidance on what to prepare and 
    do in the event that there will be a disaster!
    
    **click** Lastly, we want to assist post-disaster recovery, giving confidence and guidance to people who
    are unsure of what to do after facing a disaster. 
    
6. We gather our aim by studying a persona we created - Mr Jayeh Pradipta
    
    Pradipta was a teach that taught in Singapore for many years, but decided to return to his 
    home town, India, to stay with his family for a year or two. 
    
    During this stay, he experienced a terrible flood, and as he has been living in Singapore, he was
    at a lost of what to do, after hearing the announcement that there will be a flood.
    
    Luckily, he managed to find a shelter at a relatively close-by neighbour's house
    up the hill. After taking shelter there for almost a week, the flood is over.
    
    Pradipta was at a loss of what to do, he did not know where to go to for help, or where to stay now that
    his house was rekt by the flood
    
7. From this persona, we can clearly see the problems he faced. He was unsure of what to do, before,
 during and after the flood. 
 
    Our app simply tackles these problems.
    
8. We now introduce you the Red Assist App

9. The onboarding of the app is simple, Pradipta will fill in a few simple information about our location, and 
the location you are interested in, to allow you to look up information about that place, or get data 
on disasters relevant to that place. In this case, he will fill in the city in India he lives in.

```
From here on, will be point form for i fucking tired

10. 
    - impending dangers provides a list of possible disasters at target country
    - this dangers are simplified into 5 basic stats, for layman to understand and usable to prepare for it 
       > food, water, comms, transport and electricity
    - allows people at disaster area to know what to expect (no electricity, no food etc...)
    - allows trip planner to avoid certain countries
    - allows government or supporting entity to possible prepare recovery kits for what is needed (base on the 5 stats) super quickly without having
    heavy data analysis

11.
    For official
    - check out default plans if there is not internet
    - check which government entity is providing survival kit in which location
     
    For sharing
    - allows veteran to share their checklist, plans and recipe to prepare for the disasters
    - allows foreigners/people not so familiar to look up their plans and gain knowledge
    - allows sharing of cool tricks and tips to allow everyone to have a slightly better time during the disaster
    
12. 
    Locate Safe Havens
    - if there is cellular data or if dps is enabled, will use satellite info to find safe path and 
    possible transport mode (by super imposing satellite info, converting into binary image) to safe 
    haven. People with houses that are not hit by disasters (survive in snow storm or on high ground 
    without affected by flood) can share their location and allow people to go there and stay for 
    the disaster. 
    - locate safe house design by government in events of disaster (earthquake resistant houses)
    
13. Give instructions and contacts on where, who to contact after a disaster, 
    - location of embassy
    - available help
    - temporary shelter
    - financial assistance
