1. Hello everyone! We are 

    **click** plus plus three!

2. (pause for effect)Over 2.6 trillion $ has been donated for disaster relief from 20XX to 20XX.
   (pause) Among this, 40.33% and 21.14% of all donations were used for relief efforts for Hurricane Katrina and the Indian Ocean Tsunami respectively.
    Imagine,(pause) if we could save even 1%, just a mere percent of this money by equipping people with the necessary knowledge to survive a disaster, 
      we would be saving millions of dollars!

3. Having reviewed survivor experiences, we found that there is a lack of awareness of how to deal with disasters. This can be broken down into 3 phases, Before, During
	and after the disaster.
4. Thus, our application aims to do the following:
    (pause)Using the large amount of data NASA collects from their satellites, we can provide users with an overview of the disasters that are predicted to occur 
	within the region they are in.
    (pause)Users can also Create, Access and Share Survival Checklists to better prepare for disasters.
	(pause)Safe Havens can be identified and broadcasted to other users possessing a cellular signal, allowing survivors to make their way to safer locations.
    And finally,(pause) Clear instructions on how to proceed after a disaster has passed.

    
5. We now introduce to you, the Red Assist App!

6. Let us look at how this app helps you prepare for a disaster!
	Upon choosing a country, we can review the disasters that are known to occur regularly in the region.

7. Knowing what disasters we might encounter, we can then browse the available checklists of items to prepare. These lists are created by users and peer reviewed.
 
8. The app also features live updates of disaster predictions based on NASA's satellite imaging, so that users can be aware of oncoming disasters, and ready themselves.

9. When a disaster occurs, the logical course of action is to evacuate. After which, one would need to find a safe location to tide the disaster over. Our app allows for users
	to mark out safe havens which disaster victims can evacuate to. Should cellular data and GPS also be available, it would indicate safe routes for evacuation based on 
	satellite images. Apart from user indicated safe havens, organizations which have set up relief centers can also mark them on the map.
    
10. After a disaster has passed, many are left in confusion about how to proceed. Our app provides users with emergency helplines to seek aid from response providers. Users can
	also mark themselves as safe to allay the concerns of family members. This also provides emergency providers information on missing person counts, and facilitates the search
	and rescue operation.
    
11. Thus, with NASA's real time data, and in the spirit of helping others, our integrated solution, Red Assist, will improve the readiness of disaster victims thus 
	reducing the death toll and minimising the costs of relief efforts.
	
	Together, we can make the world a better place! This is ++3, thank you very much for your attention!
	
	Are there any questions from the floor?
